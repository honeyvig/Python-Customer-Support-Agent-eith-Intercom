# Python-Customer-Support-Agent-eith-Intercom
We are seeking two skilled customer support agents who are proficient in using Intercom and knowledgeable in AI prompting. The ideal candidates will be able to work during Eastern Standard Time (EST) hours to provide exceptional support to our clients. You should be comfortable handling customer inquiries, managing interactions, and working on the back end of our AI image generation platform to enhance the support experience. If you're passionate about customer service and have the necessary skills, we want to hear from you!
==========================
To implement the system described, you would create a Python application to assist customer support agents using Intercom API and an AI integration for prompt generation and response recommendations. Below is a Python code framework for managing and automating parts of the customer support workflow.
Key Functionalities

    Intercom Integration:
        Fetch and manage customer inquiries.
        Send and respond to messages.
    AI Prompting:
        Use an AI model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) to assist in drafting responses.
    Time Zone Handling:
        Ensure the system operates in Eastern Standard Time (EST).
    Back-End Support for AI Image Generation:
        Monitor and handle basic operations for the AI image platform.

Python Code Example

import os
import pytz
import datetime
import requests
from intercom.client import Client
from openai import ChatCompletion

# Initialize Intercom and OpenAI APIs
INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_intercom_access_token"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
intercom = Client(personal_access_token=INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN)
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# EST Timezone Handling
EST = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')

# Step 1: Fetch Customer Inquiries
def fetch_customer_inquiries():
    """Fetch recent conversations from Intercom."""
    conversations = intercom.conversations.find_all(open=True)
    inquiries = []

    for conversation in conversations:
        customer_email = conversation.user.email
        last_message = conversation.conversation_parts[-1].body if conversation.conversation_parts else "No message"
        inquiries.append({
            "id": conversation.id,
            "email": customer_email,
            "last_message": last_message,
            "updated_at": conversation.updated_at,
        })

    return inquiries

# Step 2: Generate AI-Driven Response
def generate_response(prompt):
    """Generate an AI-driven response using OpenAI."""
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0.7
        )
        return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating AI response: {e}")
        return "I'm sorry, I couldn't process your request at the moment."

# Step 3: Send Response via Intercom
def send_response(conversation_id, response):
    """Send a response to a customer via Intercom."""
    try:
        intercom.conversations.reply(
            id=conversation_id,
            type="admin",
            message_type="comment",
            body=response
        )
        print(f"Response sent to conversation {conversation_id}.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending response: {e}")

# Step 4: Process and Respond to Inquiries
def process_inquiries():
    """Process customer inquiries and send responses."""
    inquiries = fetch_customer_inquiries()

    for inquiry in inquiries:
        prompt = f"Customer Inquiry:\n{inquiry['last_message']}\nDraft a professional and helpful response."
        ai_response = generate_response(prompt)
        send_response(inquiry["id"], ai_response)

# Step 5: Monitor AI Image Generation Platform
def monitor_image_platform():
    """Simulated monitoring of the AI image generation platform."""
    try:
        # Add your platform's API calls or monitoring scripts here
        print("Monitoring AI image platform...")
        # Simulate checking status
        status = "All systems operational."
        return status
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error monitoring platform: {e}")
        return "Issue detected on the platform."

# Main Function
def main():
    """Main function to run customer support tasks."""
    print("Customer Support System Started...")
    while True:
        now = datetime.datetime.now(EST)
        print(f"Current Time (EST): {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
        
        # Process customer inquiries
        print("Processing customer inquiries...")
        process_inquiries()

        # Monitor AI platform
        print("Monitoring AI image generation platform...")
        platform_status = monitor_image_platform()
        print(f"Platform Status: {platform_status}")
        
        # Wait for a few minutes before the next cycle
        print("Waiting for the next cycle...\n")
        time.sleep(300)  # Run every 5 minutes

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation

    Intercom Integration:
        Fetches open customer conversations using the Intercom API.
        Sends AI-generated responses back to customers.

    AI-Powered Responses:
        Uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT to draft professional replies based on customer inquiries.
        The generate_response function builds a structured AI prompt and processes the AI-generated reply.

    Time Zone Handling:
        All time-based operations are performed in EST using the pytz library.

    AI Image Platform Monitoring:
        Includes a placeholder function to monitor the status of your AI image generation system (e.g., by calling platform-specific APIs or analyzing logs).

    Execution Cycle:
        The system operates in 5-minute intervals (time.sleep(300)), processing customer inquiries and monitoring the AI platform.

    EXE Conversion:
        Use PyInstaller to package the script into an executable for easy deployment.

    pyinstaller --onefile support_system.py

Prerequisites

    API Keys:
        Obtain an Intercom API token.
        Obtain an OpenAI API key.

    Python Libraries: Install necessary dependencies:

    pip install intercom-python openai pytz requests

    System Requirements:
        A system capable of running Python scripts continuously.
        Adequate memory and processing power to handle AI model calls.

This system allows customer support agents to automate repetitive tasks while maintaining the ability to handle more complex customer interactions effectively. Let me know if you need additional features or refinements!
